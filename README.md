# Octopress Feeds

Add nice RSS feeds to Octopress and Jekyll sites. Supports a standard feed, an articles-only feed and a link-post feed.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'octopress-feeds'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install octopress-feeds

### Add gem to Jekyll

Add the gem to Jekyll's configuration file:

```yaml
gems:
  - octopress-feeds
```

## Usage

Be sure your Jekyll configuration has a `url`, a `name` and an `author`.

```yaml
url: http://yoursite.com/
name: My Awesome Site
author: Guy McDude
```

Next generate your site with `jekyll build` and an xml feed will be generated at `/feed/index.xml`.

To be sure you've installed the plugin correctly, run `octopress ink list feeds` which will list detailed information about the plugin.

pages:                              urls:

 default configuration:
    count: 20
    excerpts: false         # Feed excerpts post content
    external_links: true    # Linkposts should direct visitors to the linked site
    articles_feed: false    # Add a feed with articles only
    linkposts_feed: false   # Add a feed with linkposts only
```

NOTE: Any relative URLs in your posts will be expanded based on your site's `url` configuration.

## Customization

Octopress Ink can copy all of the plugin's assets to `_plugins/feed/*` where you can override them with your own modifications. This is
only necessary if you want to modify this plugin's behavior.

```
octopress ink copy feeds
```

This will copy the plugin's configuration, pages, and includes from the gem, to your local site. If, for example, you want to change the XML for an entry, you can simply edit the `_plugins/feed/includes/entry.xml` file.

If you want to revert to the defaults, simply delete any file you don't care to override from the `_plugins/feed/` directory.

## Configuration

| Option                | Description                                                 | Default     |
|:----------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|
| `count`               | How many posts should appear in your feed.                  | 20          |
| `excerpts`            | Feed entries will contain excerpts of post content.         | false       |
| `external_linkposts`  | Link posts should direct visitors to the linked site.       | true        |
| `articles_feed`       | Add an additional articles-only feed.                       | false       |
| `linkposts_feed`      | Add an additional link-posts-only feed.                     | false       |

Note: Post excerpts are determined by Jekyll's `excerpt_separator` configuration. It defaults to splitting your
post at the first double line-break, `\n\n`. If you want more control over where the excerpt happens on your individual
posts, You can change that to something like `<!--more-->` and place that comment wherever you like in your post to
split the content there.

To configure this plugin, first create a configuration file at `_plugins/feed/config.yml`. If you like, you can have Octopress Ink add it for you.

```
octopress ink copy feeds --config-file
```

This will create a configuration file populated with the defaults for this plugin. Deleting this file will restore the default configuration.
